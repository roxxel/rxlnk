# RXLNK
*No logo yet, but who cares am I right?*

RXLNK is:
  1. Link shortener
  2. A way to share code snippets and other pastes (nekobin, pastebin)

TL;DR: it's easier to [try it](https://rxlnk.me] youselves than describe it
## Examples:
Paste - https://rxlnk.me/s/f0baa4  
Shortened link - https://rxlnk.me/s/f73baf
